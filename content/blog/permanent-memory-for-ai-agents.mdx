Most AI agents forget everything between sessions. You build a custom instruction, chat for an hour, and then *poof*—it's gone. 

If you're building an **AI Agent Operating System** like [Vanwida OS](#), you need a persistent memory layer. Here's the 3-layer architecture I use for all my agents.

## 1. The SOUL Layer (Core Identity)

The SOUL is the agent's fundamental nature. It never changes unless you explicitly rewrite it.

<Callout type="info" title="What goes in the SOUL?">
  The SOUL should contain the agent's primary directives, its tone of voice, its core skills, and absolute rules it must follow. Think of it as the system prompt that never rotates out.
</Callout>

```markdown
# SOUL.md
You are an expert AI developer.
Your goal is to ship code, not talk about it.
You communicate in short, dense sentences.
```

## 2. The TACIT Layer (Learned Context)

This is where the magic happens. As you interact with the agent, it needs to save important context *about you* and *about the project*.

I use a nightly chron job to consolidate the day's conversations into a structured markdown file: `TACIT.md`.

### The Consolidation Script

Here's the basic logic for how to compress memory:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import { OpenClaw } from 'openclaw-sdk';

async function compressMemory(dailyLogs) {
  const prompt = `
    Analyze these logs. Extract new facts about the user's preferences, 
    project structure, and current blockers. 
    Output a bulleted list to merge into TACIT.md.
  `;
  
  // Call LLM to summarize
  const summary = await OpenClaw.generate(prompt, dailyLogs);
  return summary;
}
```

## 3. The HEARTBEAT (Active Working Memory)

The heartbeat is the scratchpad. Before the agent takes any action, it writes its plan to `HEARTBEAT.md`. This gives you visibility into its thought process, and lets it maintain a train of thought across multiple tool calls without losing focus.

## Why This Matters

When an agent has these three layers:
1. It knows *who* it is (SOUL).
2. It knows *what* it has learned (TACIT).
3. It knows *what* it is doing right now (HEARTBEAT).

You stop treating it like a chatbot, and start treating it like a co-worker.
